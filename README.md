#Day63 of #100DaysChallenge

I've just made nice landing pages and I just used Tailwind CSS because I got bored of writing vanilla CSS cuz tailwind just makes everything faster and more funüòò,
just added  smooth animations when users scroll up and down, and it's mobile responsive

yeah it was a fun and educational experience, and I‚Äôm looking forward to creating more awesome projects in the upcoming days. Thank y'all 

Let's keep pushing forward ‚ö°Ô∏è
